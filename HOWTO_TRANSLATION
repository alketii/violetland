To translate violetland in your language:

xgettext -d cat_violetland -s -o violetland.pot ./src/program.cpp ./src/windows/*.cpp --keyword="_"

If the translation file does not exist:
msginit -l fr -o french.po -i violetland.pot )> replace "fr" by your locale and "french" by the english name of your language
If it exist you just need to update it:
msgmerge -U french.po violetland.pot

Then, edit french.po with a text editor, or with an editor of po file.
For example:
poedit french.po
Don't forget to configure the package name and version.
And also the charset of the catalog (I use utf-8 for french)

When you have finished :
msgfmt -c -v -o fr/LC_MESSAGES/violetland.mo french.po )>replace fr by your locale ;-)
