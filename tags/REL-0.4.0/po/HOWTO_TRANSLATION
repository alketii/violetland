To translate violetland in your language:

add you locale to "LANGUAGES", for example "fr" for "french".

run generate.sh

Then, edit the po file with a text editor, or with an editor for po files ( http://www.poedit.net/ ).
For example:
poedit fr.po
Don't forget to configure the package name and version.
And also the charset of the catalog (I use utf-8 for french)

When you have finished :
run compile.sh and launch violetland to test it!
