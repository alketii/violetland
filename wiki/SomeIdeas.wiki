#summary Just some ideas for further developing

= Perks =

  * Perks as tree instead of plain list
  * Player can have two weapons simultaneously (may be various rules)
  * Drop or fix Wide Sight

= Weapons =

  * Flamethrower (damages the surface, like a grenade launcher; need animation; monsters should burn, burn each other and coal)
  * Gattling gun (like minigun in Crimsonland: player speed decreases, but weapon have big holder, high shooting rate and powerfull bullets).
  * Mines ;)

= Graphics =

  * Don't use opengl lighting, use multitexturing

= Monsters =

  * Monster which can shoot
  * Monster which can teleport (he should has short teleport range and should do some preparations (visible to player) just before teleportation
  * Monster which goes to player and explodes, damages player (kamikaze) (player can shoot him to damage some other monsters).

= Gameplay =

  * Some obstacles on map as new game mode (rocks - shelter from the bullets, trees - where monsters can be hidden)
